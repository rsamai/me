				<h3>Design Choices</h3>

				<h4>Analytical Hierarchy Process - Prioritizing Tasks</h4>
				<nobr>The process was scoring the requirements on a scale of 1/9 - 9 on the following factors: </nobr>
				<blockquote> Value: How important/urgent and valuable is this feature to implement in my application?</blockquote>
				<blockquote> Cost: How much time and resources will building this feature require?</blockquote>
				<p>
					<br> 1 means row and column have equal value 5 means row is strongly more than column
					<br> 9 means row is extremely more than column
					<br> 1/5 means column is strongly more than row
					<br> 1/5 means column is strongly more than row
				</p>

				<p>For example, in the YELLOW box, we see that Schedule Tasks in advance is strongly more valuable than Add new tasks because
					users will want a single task to run in advance before adding new ones. Users may not have a smartwatch to enable the
					Sleep Mode, so they would want to preset times to execute tasks.
					<br> </p>
				<b>Results</b>
				<p>From this numeric heavy analysis, the chart shows that the most high priority requirement is 1) Pause Audio Media, 2)
					View History, 3) Schedule Tasks in advance, 4) Add new tasks.
					<br> Though this gave me a great idea of what requirements to tackle first, the method has its flaws:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Requirements aren't directly comparable or independent</li>
					<li>It's difficult to stay consistent with scoring and comparisons</li>
					<li>Hard to quantify differences</li>
				</ul>

				<p>From this numeric heavy analysis, the chart shows that the most high priority requirement is 1) Pause Audio Media, 2)
					View History, 3) Schedule Tasks in advance, 4) Add new tasks. As I analyzed the results, it made sense, as the Pause
					Audio Media would be the first task we program and thus allowing simple functionality to the MVP application.

				<br />

				<h4>Concerns-Based Adoption Model</h4>
				<p>Goal: Decide which device, smartwatch, and data storage option to work on first, in order to make a Minimum Viable Product.
					</p>
				<nobr>I chose the following metrics because I found them appropriate to our design decision needs. Each metric has a different
					weight for each design decision based on relevance.</nobr>
				<ul>
					<li>Security -Whether the device itself is secure and if we can keep our interactions with the device controlled.</li>
					<li>Maintainability -How often the device get updated or a new generation is released, thus needing to change our code to
						match any new deprecations or additions.</li>
					<li>Commonality -How common these devices are used and owned by our target customer so that we allow maximum usage.</li>
					<li>Interoperability -The ability of computer systems or software to exchange and make use of information on different platforms
						and environments.</li>
					<li>Reliability -How often these devices have bugs, crashes and how easy it is to retrieve information, documentation, and
						customer support.</li>
				</ul>
				<blockquote>The ratings are on a scale from [-1, +1], higher being better
					<br> The risk for each alternative was on a scale from [0,1], 1 being the most risky
					<br> The benefit score is an equation = (weighted average of the metrics’ rating) x ( |Risk - 1|
					<br> Desirability = Benefit/Cost <br> </blockquote>
				<b>Results</b>
				<p>The CBAM recommended we pursue the Amazon Smart Plug, Letscom Fitness Tracker, and Oracle Database. These options agreed
					with our predictions because The Amazon smart plug is a fair common, cost-effective device and the API seemed friendly
					to work with. The other smartwatches are costly and have high security barriers and my teammates were familiar and eager
					to learn Oracle DB.
					<br> Overall, the cons to an algorithmic approach to design decisions are that it’s unrealistic to fairly rank qualitative
					factors with numbers, so we must always use our human judgement calls, using the CBAM as a tool.

				<h3>Reflection + Takeaways</h3>

				<h4>Overall</h4>
				<p> Coding isn’t always the hardest part of a project. This was my first time taking 2+ months to thoroughly research and
					scope out a project before coding a single line. Looking back, I can’t imagine how I jumped into projects without these
					steps because they were integral to our fundamental understanding of the problem and best alotting time and playing
					to our team’s strengths.
					<br> Due to the course structure, each team member made their version of a storyboard individually, then we were allowed
					to collaborate. This technique allowed us to think creatively on our own, rather than piling on ideas with tunnel vision,
					and have a diverse set of ideas; however, it was a challenge to merge everyone’s.
					<br> Defining the goals, MVP features, and vocabulary of a large scaled project is an ITERATIVE, sometimes frustrating process.
				</p>

				<blockquote> When each of us first walked through our storyboard, it seemed like we were building completely different apps. </blockquote>

				<p>
					<br>After combining our individual user stories and functional requirements, we spent 5 hours stepping through each member’s
					version and how we could combine the promising components of each. But in the following meeting, we almost completing
					scrapped it and started over. I didn’t expect finalizing this to take so long, but the challenge was making requirements
					not overlap, not showing implementation (ex. click button that triggers a database query), and being precise with any
					time periods or numbers. </p>

				<h4>Nomenclature</h4>
				<p>Our individual versions had a wide range of nomenclature and quite unique user journeys. In my version 1, I used the
					word “skills” instead of “tasks” and the user would create a “cycle” for each day composed of skills. Although, we pivoted
					because it seemed tedious to create an ordered list each day. It’s more practical and familiar to have a calendar setting.
					<br>Additionally, my v1 had “logs” to display the status of each skill executed, but my teammate pointed out that “logs”
					and “skills” were very developer oriented nomenclature, which isn’t inclusive. Developers know from their IDEs or similar
					that logs are the summary of all actions completed and errors. Amazon Alexa skills are a familiar concept and developers
					know it’s an executable task, usually paired with a device.
					<br> After several whiteboard sessions and asking random users in the library to walk through our screens and talking out
					loud, we decided on the final nomenclature and sequence of steps that was most intuitive.
				</p>

				<h4>Android App and Dark Mode</h4>
				<p>This was my first time designing an Android and dark mode app. As a primarily Apple user, I hadn’t explored much of Material
					design.
				</p>
				<blockquote>Material design has imaginative thought, careful emotion, and refreshing logic behind it.</blockquote>
				<p>
					<br> There are so many amazing resources and videos about the philosophy and it values the user’s learning curve and needs.
					Material Design makes sure the user knows their power via clear feedback and emphasis on motion design. This is the
					main difference, compared to flat design in iOS which has significant discoverability and the user must guess and memorize
					design patterns.
					<br> My research of 30+ Android and Dark mode apps (Twitter Dark, Spotify, etc) was impactful and a visual way to understand
					the common flows and feedback icons, like the back button and common complimentary colors. ||Dark mode is not just inverting
					colors. It makes you wonder what’s essential and what’s not. As a beginner, it’s tricky to do in material design, which
					usually shows shadows and depth, even on black backgrounds. I could’t have done it without the Sketch template on Material
					Design and materialdesign.io.
				</p>

				<h4>Team</h4>
				<p> This team was incredibly driven and had a growth-mindset. Even when we scrapped entire designs, we didn’t take the easy
					way out. We meticulously investigated why a certain method isn’t working or why we’re not on the same page and solved
					the problems. From our Petra dinner nomming on falafels, to stress-eating Thai food and working till 4:30 AM in the
					library the night before the presentation, we trusted and helped one another learn various concepts and complete deliverables.
					I’m very grateful for this dynamic group and I’m looking forward to coding the app in the next couple of months with
					them.</p>
